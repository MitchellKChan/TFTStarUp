                    <br>
                    <p>TFT Star Up is a tool for practicing one's rerolling skills based on 
                        gameplay from the auto battler videogame Teamfight Tactics (TFT).  
                        Players may need to refresh their shop multiple times (“rolling down”) 
                        within a single planning phase to find particular units they want, and 
                        how well they can repeatedly refresh and buy units within a short time 
                        can often be the difference between victory and defeat.
                    </p>

                    <p class="instructions">Controls</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The tool focuses exclusively on the game aspects integral to rolling down: 
                        the <span class="bold">Shop</span> and <span class="bold">Bench</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <span class="bold">Shop</span> section at the bottom of the screen
                        contains the 5 units you are offered at a time, which can be rerolled by 
                        either pressing the <span class="bold">"D"</span> key or clicking on the 
                        <span class="bold">"Refresh"</span> button.  Shop units will display their 
                        name, image, and tier denoted by color (<span class="gray">gray</span> is
                        the lowest,  <span class="gold">gold</span> is the highest).  Units have 
                        certain odds of appearing in the shop based on their tier; as your level 
                        increased, odds for higher tiers increase and odds for lower tiers decrease.  
                        Units can be purchased by clicking on them, which will appear on the bench.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The <span class="bold">Bench</span> section above the Shop can hold up to 9
                        units, which appear there when bought from the shop.  When a third copy of a 
                        unit on the bench is purchased, the three copies combine to 
                        <span class="bold">"star up"</span> that unit to a 2-star copy.  Units can be
                        sold to free up bench space by hovering over them and pressing the 
                        <span class="bold">"E"</span> key.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You may adjust certain settings for the rolldown before beginning.  Please enjoy!</p>
